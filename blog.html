          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a
            wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such
            as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself
            or as an accompaniment to another dish. As a homemade dish, fried
            rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes,
            leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during
            the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace
            their origins to Chinese fried rice.

            Here is a recipe from Lola's Kitchen:
           <blockquote cite="https://cheflolaskitchen.com/nigerian-fried-rice-recipe/">Fried rice is a common street food in Asia. In some Asian countries,
            small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialize
            in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find
            fried rice street hawkers moving through the streets with their food
            cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many
            Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection
            of optional garnishes and side dishes.</blockquote>

            <p>2 large green peppers</p>  
            <p>1 small cabbage</p> 
            <p>1 large onion</p> 
            <p>½ cup green beans</p> 
            <p>4 large carrots</p>
            <p> 2 cups chicken stock</p>  
            <p>½ tbsp. white pepper</p> 
            <p>3 cooking spoons groundnut oil</p> 
            <p>4 large chicken thighs (or other meat of choice)</p>
            <p>1 tsp. curry powder</p> 
            <p> Seasoning and salt to taste</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Method</h3>
          <div class="list">
            <p>1. Wash and spice the chicken pieces. Boil until tender, then fry or grill them.</p>
            <p>2. Chop the carrot, cabbage, green pepper and green beans.</p>  
            <p>3. Parboil the rice, then cook in the chicken stock (add 2 extra cups of water). Cook until almost tender, then set aside.</p> 
            <p>4. Put a clean frying pan on fire. Add groundnut oil and onion to the pan. Stir for a minute then add the carrot and green beans. Stir for another minute.</p> 
            <p>5. Add the cabbage, green pepper, white pepper, curry, seasoning and salt to taste (try to keep it a bit spicy). Stir-fry for 2 minutes.</p>
